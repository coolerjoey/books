# Why we need 8086 assembly?

As far as I remember NASA announced they decided not to use 8086 CPU any more several years ago.  
Currently even NASA, they always use the oldest but the stablest chip, does not use 8086.  
So you might not understand why I write this document about 8086.

## If you understand the basic concepts of 8086 CPU architecture, you can start the latest Intel CPU manuals quickly when you need it.

For example, if you want to know Intel Core-i5 processor, you can google "Intel processor manual" and find several pdf files.  
Each has more than 1000 pages. Yes, you can start reading, but I'm not sure when you finish reading.

Let's google "8086 manual". you will find a pdf file of 200 pages. Many pages are related to inter-connection with other chips that is not used currently and description of each assembly command. Only dozen of pages are for 8086 CPU architecture. You can read it in a day. And you can try it easily with emulator.

Basic concepts are the same. Even register names are almost same. AX in 8086, RAX in Core-i5. And assembly command is the same. Only the latest CPU has several features like virtualization or memory paging. If you are already familiar with the basic concepts, you can start the latest features in the latest processor quickly.

## The most of you don't need to know the latest CPU.

What you need is to understand the deep inside of the programming language and better debugging skill.  
You only need to know the basic concept of CPU and computer hardware.

But it's a little bit difficult to try the modern CPU on your laptop. Assembly language for 64bit CPUs is not as simple as 8086.  
If the basic concepts of 8086 and Intel Core-i5 are the same, why do need to know Intel Core-i5?

And there are wonderful emulator for us to try 8086 and control some devices.  
Why do we need to try to control the device on our laptop?
