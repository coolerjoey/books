# Introduction to the emu8086 program

Current computers are too complex for us to start the language of the beginning.  
I think the computer of the beginning is the best to learn the language of the beginning.  
So we will use 8086 processor that was used when the computer industry started.  
You might be able to buy the 8086 processor on Amazon.  
But you cannot do anything with only 8086 processor chip.  
You need more devices to input program and out the result.  
For instance, you need a Mainboard, a monitor and a keyboard that are able to be connected to 8086 chip.  
But we have some emulation programs that help us to experience 8086 chip on our desktop.  
In some University there was classes to make hand-made computer with processor chip, SRAM and some other devices like a Text-lcd and number-keypad. You can make the similar machine to Apple-1 or the first generation calculator.  
If you don't know what the Apple-1 is, please google it. You would find an ugly machine looks like old-fashined typewriter.  
Anyway we don't need to make any machine. Let us use the emulator program 'emu8086'.

[Download emu8086](http://www.emu8086.com/)

There are many other emulator programs.  
If you are using Linux machine, you might want to another emulator: [I8086emu](http://i8086emu.sourceforge.net/)

If you run the emu8086 program, you can see the small text editor window. There is an emulate menu in the file menulist.
If you select the emulate menu, you can see following window.
You might not understand anything in the window. It might looks very odd.
But now you're ready to start.

PS. Several years ago, emu8086 was a free software but current version you should pay a little money. If you're very poor, you can google the old version. This document was written in many years ago when the emu8086 was free. That's why I used emu8086. So some menu is not the same with the latest version. But the essential functions are the same. So you don't need the latest version to read this document. 

And also you don't need to emu8086 program. You can use the other free emulator. Again, the essential functions are the same in most of the emulators. If you can read the register value and memory value, and run assembly instructions one by one, that's all we will do. And any 8086 emulator can do it.

PS. I tried wine-1.6.2 on Ubuntu 15.10 but emu8086 didn't run. Please inform me if you succeed to run emu8086 on Linux.
